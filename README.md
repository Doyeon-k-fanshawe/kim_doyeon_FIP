## Making Three Pages Websites!

TODO: Creating three pages website and well-written readme file and then uploading all files on the Github repository.


### Book Garden

The website theme is the book caf√© where people can read many books and drink coffee or tea simultaneously. The website's name is book garden since I want to illustrate various books in the book cafe. So, visitors can enjoy various books in our book cafe as if they could see many flowers in the garden. In addition, people can take a rest and feel calm when they visit the garden. The website is named Book Garden to make people feel like they're in the garden.
